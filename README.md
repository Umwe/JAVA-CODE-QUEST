# JAVA-CODE-QUEST
CodeQuest: Java Adventures" is an interactive game that takes players on a journey through a virtual world filled with coding challenges and quests. The game is designed to teach basic Java programming concepts in a fun and engaging way.

We have a CodeQuestGame class that contains the main method, representing the game.
The game starts with a welcome message and then proceeds to the first quest (calculating the area of a rectangle).
After completing the first quest, the game moves on to the second quest (checking if a number is prime).
Players input values for calculations, and the game provides feedback based on their inputs and code.
Finally, a congratulatory message is displayed upon completing the quests.
This code gives you a starting point for structuring the game's logic and interaction with players. For a full-fledged game, you would need to expand upon this foundation, including more quests, a graphical user interface, a database to track player progress, and more complex coding challenges.
